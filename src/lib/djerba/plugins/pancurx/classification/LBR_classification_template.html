	<h3 class="lbr">Homologous Recombination (HR) Deficiency Flags</h3>
      <p class="lbr">Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD) is a cellular condition where key genes 
            involved in homologous recombination, like BRCA1 and BRCA2, are mutated or deficient. 
            This impairs the accurate repair of DNA double-strand breaks, leading to 
            genomic instability and an increased risk of cancers, particularly breast and 
            ovarian cancers. HRD is associated with heightened sensitivity to certain 
            DNA-damaging treatments, aiding in treatment selection. 
            Less than 4 flags tend to be proficient, while greater than 6 tends to be HRD. 
            sLH is somatic loss of heterozygosity. Cosmic signature 3 is also indicative of HRD. </p>

      <h3 class="lbr">Mismatch Repair (MMR) Deficiency Flags</h3>
      <p class="lbr">
        Mismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRd) is a cellular condition marked by impaired DNA mismatch repair mechanisms. 
        This deficiency prevents the correction of errors that occur during DNA replication, 
        leading to the accumulation of mutations and microsatellite instability. MMRd is often associated with Lynch syndrome,
         a hereditary cancer syndrome, and is associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) or polymerase deficiencies (POLD/E). 
         Cosmic signature 20 and 26 are also indicative of MMRD.</p>
