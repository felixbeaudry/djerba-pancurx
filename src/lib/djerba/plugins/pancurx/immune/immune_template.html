      <p class="lbr">
            Immunotherapy leverages the body's immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells and 
            its success hinges on deciphering the tumor microenvironment.
            The problem is tumors can evade immune surveillance through various mechanisms. 
            Immune cell deconvolution for this sample (shown as <b>X</b>) based on RNAseq 
            for four cell types (CD8+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells, Natural Killer [NK] T-cells, M1 Macrophages) 
            and compare these results to the LBR cohort (N=57) shown as boxplots.</p>
