    <strong>Coverage: </strong>Mean number of bases covering each sequenced base. Minimum coverage threshold is 30x (with a target of 40x).
    <br><strong>Healthy Blood Controls (HBCs):</strong> Something about them, how they were sequenced etc.

    <p>This assay is a comprehensive next generation sequencing assay, specifically plasma whole genome sequencing (WGS). 
        Plasma libraries are prepared using the KAPA Hyper Prep kit with DNA extracted from cfDNA. 
        Paired-end sequencing is performed using the NovaSeq6000 technology. 
        Alignments are performed using <a href="https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/">bwa</a> mem (0.7.12) against reference genome <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001405.39/">GRCh38.p13</a> and processed with <a href="https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037052812-MarkDuplicates-Picard-">Picard</a> (2.21.2), which includes duplicate marking. 
        Final detection rate is produced by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32483360/">MRDetect</a> (1.0).
    Assay results were collated into the report document by <a href="https://github.com/oicr-gsi/djerba">Djerba</a> (0.3.20) using pipeline v.1.0.</p>

${html_builder().section_cells_begin("<h3>Disclaimer</h3>","supp")}

  <p>Based on a minimum coverage of 30, the sensitivity is XX%. The limit of detection is XX% VAF for SNVs.</p>
  <p><strong>Genes tested</strong>: Plasma whole genome sequencing encompasses all genes and intergenic regions in a specimen, and gene annotation is not performed in this assay.</p>

<p>This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by OICR Genomics. It has not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.</p>
