<p>Plasma whole genome sequencing (pWGS) is a comprehensive next generation sequencing assay for the detection of minimal residual disease. 
  Plasma libraries were prepared using the KAPA Hyper Prep kit with DNA extracted from cfDNA. 
  Paired-end sequencing was performed using the NovaSeq6000 technology. 
  Alignments were performed using <a href=${constants.BWAMEM_LINK}>bwa</a> mem (${constants.BWAMEM_VERSION}) 
  against reference genome <a href=${constants.REFERENCE_GENOME_LINK}>${constants.REFERENCE_GENOME_VERSION}</a> 
  and processed with <a href=${constants.PICARD_LINK}>Picard</a> (${constants.PICARD_VERSION}), which includes duplicate marking. 
  Reads were filtered for ctDNA likelihood and matches with primary tumour by <a href=${constants.MRDETECT_LINK}>MRDetect</a> (${constants.MRDETECT_VERSION}). 
  The sample is compared against a control cohort of Healthy Blood Controls (HBCs) sequenced and processed at OICR using the same procedure as any tested plasma sample.

  Assay results were collated into the report document by <a href=constants.DJERBA_LINK>Djerba</a> (djerba v.${constants.DJERBA_VERSION}, pWGS plugin v.${constants.PWGS_DJERBA_VERSION}) 
  using pipeline ${constants.DJERBA_PIPELINE_VERSION}.
